# Deep Reinforcement Learning

## The Cartpole Problem
The setting was created by GYM, the documentation can be found [here](https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/). The task is to train an agent that learns how to balance a stick on a cartpole.   

I solved it during a university course about Deep Reinforcement Learning with a DQN agent.
